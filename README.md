![Image alt](https://github.com/YakymivLuybomyr/2022-Russia-Ukraine-War/blob/main/DATA/WAR%202022%20dashboard%201.png)
Purpose:
This dashboard presents a comprehensive summary of Russia‚Äôs military equipment losses throughout the full-scale war in Ukraine.

What it shows:

Number of days of war: 1145 (as of April 13, 2025).

Total losses by category: drones, artillery, armored vehicles, tanks, aircraft, helicopters, MLRS.

Average daily losses by year.

Percentage contribution of each equipment type to the total losses.

A hierarchical view of the most to least affected categories.

Insights:

Drones are the most heavily affected category, accounting for over 34% of all losses.

Artillery and armored vehicles follow as the next most significant losses.

Losses peaked in 2023 across most equipment types, indicating intense warfare during that year.

Aircraft and helicopters remain the least affected, with only marginal figures compared to ground assets.

Purpose:
This dashboard offers focused analyses for the top three categories of Russian military losses: drones, artillery systems, and armored personnel carriers (APCs).

What it shows:

Yearly total losses from 2022 to 2025.

Quarterly breakdown of losses for trend tracking.

Average daily losses per year per equipment type.

Insights:

Drone losses show exponential growth in 2023, remaining high through 2024 and early 2025. This underlines the central role of UAVs in Russian operations and the corresponding vulnerability to Ukrainian countermeasures.

Artillery systems experienced steady and significant attrition, reflecting their central role in Russia‚Äôs battlefield strategy.

APC losses peaked in 2023, likely due to increased Ukrainian use of portable anti-armor weapons. Their losses taper slightly in 2024‚Äì2025.

üñºÔ∏è Image 3: Timeline Analysis of Equipment Losses
Purpose:
To visualize synchronized loss patterns for all major equipment types over time.

What it shows:

Monthly and quarterly loss trends across categories (drones, artillery, APCs, aircraft, tanks, MRL).

Longitudinal comparison of intensity from 2022 to 2025.

Insights:

The highest spike in losses occurred in mid-2023, consistent across drones, artillery, and vehicles.

Seasonal cycles are evident ‚Äî particularly losses concentrated in spring and summer quarters, likely reflecting operational offensives.

By early 2025, the intensity of losses appears to plateau, potentially signaling strategic recalibration or depleted resources on the Russian side.
