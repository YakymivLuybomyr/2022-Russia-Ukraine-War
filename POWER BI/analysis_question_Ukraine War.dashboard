ðŸ“˜ ANALYTICAL REPORT: Russian Equipment Losses During the War Against Ukraine
Based on Power BI Dashboard (2022â€“2025)

ðŸ”¹ 1. General Dashboard Overview
Purpose:
To provide a comprehensive overview of Russian military equipment losses during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine from 2022 to April 2025.

What it shows:
1.The total number of war days.

2.Total losses by equipment category: drones, armored vehicles (APCs), artillery, tanks, aircraft, helicopters, MLRS (multiple rocket launchers), and fuel transport.

3.Annual loss figures and their share in overall losses.

4.Yearly average daily losses.

5.Hierarchical structure of losses (most to least lost equipment).

6.Percentage distribution of each category from total confirmed losses.

Key insights:

1.Drones account for the highest share of total losses (over 34%), followed by armored vehicles and artillery systems.

2.2023 marks the peak year in terms of total equipment loss, across nearly all categories.

3.The average daily losses show a significant increase in 2023, then a moderate drop in 2024 and early 2025, possibly due to depletion of resources or a change in operational tactics.

4.The smallest share of losses comes from aircraft and helicopters, suggesting either fewer deployments or more efficient protection measures.

5.The data reflects the shift of the Russian military from conventional heavy equipment toward unmanned and mobile platforms (e.g., drones and light vehicles).

ðŸ”¹ 2. Drones Dashboard

Purpose:
To present a detailed analysis of Russian drone losses across years and quarters.

What it shows:

1.Total yearly drone losses from 2022 to 2025.

2.Quarterly drone loss trends.

3.Average daily losses per year.

Key insights:

1.Drone losses increased drastically in 2023, aligning with the intensified use of UAVs for reconnaissance, kamikaze strikes, and electronic warfare.

2.In 2024, the losses remain high but slightly lower than 2023, suggesting better drone tactics or improved counter-drone measures by Ukraine.

3.The sustained level in 2025 indicates that drones remain central to Russiaâ€™s tactical strategy, despite high attrition.

4.Quarterly data reveals spikes in drone losses during spring and summer months, correlating with major offensive operations.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Artillery Dashboard

Purpose:
To track the dynamics of Russian artillery equipment losses.

What it shows:

1.Total annual and quarterly losses in artillery systems.

2.Daily average losses for each year.

Key insights:

1.Artillery losses are consistently high, especially in 2022 and 2023, reflecting its heavy use in prolonged bombardments and siege tactics.

2.The drop in artillery losses in 2025 may suggest a shift toward more mobile or long-range alternatives like guided missiles.

3.The data indicates that artillery continues to play a foundational role in Russian ground warfare strategy, despite heavy losses and increased drone reliance.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Armored Vehicles (APC) Dashboard

Purpose:
To analyze losses in Russian armored personnel carriers (APCs) used for troop movement and protection.

What it shows:

1.Total APC losses each year and by quarter.

2.Average daily APC losses.

Key insights:

1.APC losses saw a sharp increase in 2023, which matches Ukraine's increased use of anti-armor systems (e.g., Javelins, drones with ATGMs).

2.The lower losses in 2025 may be a result of reduced large-scale troop movements or better tactical concealment.

3.The data reflects how vulnerable armored mobility has become in modern warfare due to the proliferation of portable anti-armor technology.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Combined Equipment Timeline
Purpose:
To visualize time-based loss trends across all major equipment categories in one synchronized view.

What it shows:

1.Equipment losses by month and quarter from 2022 through early 2025.

2.Comparative curves for drones, artillery, APCs, tanks, aircraft, and MLRS.

Key insights:

1.There is a clear seasonal pattern, with elevated losses in spring and summer, matching known periods of Ukrainian counteroffensives.

2.Drones and armored vehicles dominate the total losses curve.

3.The flattening of loss rates in 2025 may reflect battlefield stagnation or strategic redeployments.

4.This dashboard highlights the shift in combat dynamics, with traditional heavy equipment still present but increasingly supplemented by drones and light units.
